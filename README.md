### Greetings, I'm Mike

I really enjoy working on all parts of web development. Lately I have been working mostly with Javascript, Node, React JS/Next JS, Jamstack, Express server, working with data (Sanity, MySQL, MongoDB, etc).

My non-coding hobbies include: biking, gardening, baseball, pets, enjoying the outdoors in general.
